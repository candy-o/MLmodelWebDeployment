# MLmodelWebDeployment

Once we have built and saved a model we need to deploy our model to the internet.

Here are the the three Udemy Courses I purchased on-sale with regard to “Deploying ML models to the Web”



Deploying Machine Learning models with flask for beginners (2.5 total hours)

Code:
https://github.com/candy-o/MLmodelWebDeployment (flaskdata.zip)

This 2.5 hour course is a practical hands on course where we learn to deploy our trained machine learning models aka neural networks with the flask web framework.

This is a beginners class. You don't need any pre-knowledge about flask but you should know about neural networks and python. We will learn and code step by step together and I will explain what we do along the way.

Besides machine learning apis we will also use transfer learning to use an advanced neural network and use a user friendly HTML template to give the enduser a visual appealing interface for our application. The user can upload an image and our model will return an image classification prediction

Quickly create an API; deploy your ML model to Heroku PaaS web platform.




Deployment of Machine Learning Models (9 hours video)

This is an intermediate course: deploying ML model to Heroku using Docker versus Dockerless, LaaS AWS ECS, CI/CD, pipelines, serving models via RestAPI

Description:
What is model deployment?

Deployment of machine learning models, or simply, putting models into production, means making your models available to your other business systems. By deploying models, other systems can send data to them and get their predictions, which are in turn populated back into the company systems. Through machine learning model deployment, you and your business can begin to take full advantage of the model you built.

When we think about data science, we think about how to build machine learning models, we think about which algorithm will be more predictive, how to engineer our features and which variables to use to make the models more accurate. However, how we are going to actually use those models is often neglected. And yet this is the most important step in the machine learning pipeline. Only when a model is fully integrated with the business systems, we can extract real value from its predictions.



Why take this course?

This is the first and only online course where you can learn how to deploy machine learning models. In this course, you will learn every aspect of how to put your models in production. The course is comprehensive, and yet easy to follow. Throughout this course you will learn all the steps and infrastructure required to deploy machine learning models professionally.

In this course, you will have at your fingertips, the sequence of steps that you need to follow to deploy a machine learning model, plus a project template with full code, that you can adapt to deploy your own models.



What is the course structure?

Part 1: The Research Environment

The course begins from the most common starting point for the majority of data scientists: a Jupyter notebook with a machine learning model trained in it.

Part 2: Understanding Machine Learning Systems

An overview of key architecture and design considerations for different types of machine learning models. This part sets the theoretical foundation for the practical part of the course.

Part 3: From Research to Production Code

A hands-on project with complete source code, which takes you through the process of converting your notebooks into production ready code.

Part 4: Deployment Tooling

Continuing with the hands-on project, this section takes you through the necessary tools for real production deployments, like CI/CD, testing, model cloud storage and more.

Part 5: Deployments

In this section, you will deploy models to both cloud platforms (Heroku) and cloud infrastructure (AWS).

Part 6: Bonus sections

In addition, there are dedicated sections which discuss handling big data, deep learning and common issues encountered when deploying models to production.



Important:

This course will help you take the first steps towards putting your models in production. You will learn how to go from a Jupyter notebook to a fully deployed machine learning model, considering CI/CD, and deploying to cloud platforms and infrastructure.

But, there is a lot more to model deployment, like model monitoring, advanced deployment orchestration with Kubernetes, and scheduled workflows with Airflow, as well as various testing paradigms such as shadow deployments that are not covered in this course.

Course Description

Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning is affecting every area of our lives and society. Google, Amazon, Netflix, Uber, Facebook and many more industries are using AI and ML models in their products.

The opportunities and advantages of Machine Learning are quite numerous.

What if you could also build your own machine learning models?

What if you can build something useful from the ML model you have spent time creating and make some profit while helping people and changing the world?

In this wonderful course, we will be exploring the various ways of converting your machine learning models into useful web applications and products.

We will move beyond just building machine learning models into build products from our ML Models.

Products that you can give to your customers and other users to benefit from. We will be adding simple UI to our AI and ML models.



With every section of the course you will develop new skills and improve your understanding of this challenging yet important sub-field of Data Science and Machine Learning.

This course is unscripted,fun and exciting but at the same time we dive deep into building Machine Learning web applications.
